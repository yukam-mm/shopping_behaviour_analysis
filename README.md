# shopping_behaviour_analysis
This project analyzes customer shopping behavior to uncover patterns in purchasing habits, spending trends, and demographic influences.
Data Analytics Project — README

**Overview:**

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow: loading raw data in Python, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), cleaning and transforming data, querying relational databases using SQL, building an interactive Power BI dashboard, generating a written report, and creating a presentation using Gamma.

The goal is to showcase practical data analytics skills across Python, SQL, visualization, and business reporting in a recruiter-friendly format.

**Dataset:**

Source: Kaggle
Type: Structured tabular data
Description: Customer shopping behaviour

**Tools & Technologies:**

Programming & Analysis
	•	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
	•	Jupyter Notebook

Databases & SQL
	•	PostgreSQL

Visualization & Reporting
	•	Power BI (interactive dashboard)
  - Documentation (PDF file)
	•	Gamma (presentation slides)

**Project Workflow & Steps:**

1. Data Loading
	•	Imported dataset using Python
	•	Validated schema, column types, and missing values

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	•	Summary statistics
	•	Distribution analysis
	•	Correlation analysis
	•	Detection of outliers and anomalies

3. Data Cleaning & Transformation
	•	Removed duplicates and invalid records
	•	Handled missing values
	•	Standardized formats (dates, text, numeric fields)
	•	Feature engineering and derived metrics

4. SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)
	•	Created database tables
	•	Loaded cleaned dataset into SQL
	•	Executed analytical queries, including:
	•	Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
	•	Joins across tables
	•	Window functions
	•	Time-based trend analysis

5. Power BI Dashboard Development
	•	Built an interactive dashboard for insights

6. Reporting
	•	Generated a structured analytics report summarizing findings
	•	Highlighted insights, risks, and recommendations

7. Presentation (Gamma)
	•	Built a professional slide deck
	•	Focused on storytelling with data
	•	Presented business-focused insights

**Results & Insights:**

• Strong opportunity to increase subscription adoption through clearer value
messaging
• Repeat buyers show high potential to move into a long-term loyalty segment
• Discounts drive short-term sales but require margin optimization
• Top-rated and best-selling products perform best when featured in campaigns
• High-revenue age groups and express-shipping users represent priority targets


Business value:
	•	Supports data-driven decision-making
	•	Improves operational visibility
	•	Demonstrates end-to-end analytics capability
